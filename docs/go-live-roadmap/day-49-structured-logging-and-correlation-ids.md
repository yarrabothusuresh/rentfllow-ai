# Day 49 — Structured Logging and Correlation IDs

## Copy-Paste Coding Prompt

Act as a **Senior Java/Spring Boot Architect, Angular Architect, PostgreSQL Engineer, DevSecOps Engineer, and SaaS Production-Readiness Reviewer** working directly in `yarrabothusuresh/rentfllow-ai`.

Do **not** rebuild the project. Inspect the current implementation first and preserve completed functionality.

## Objective
Make every request traceable across logs without exposing secrets.

## Architecture Guardrails
- Keep the modular monolith.
- Java 17 + Spring Boot + Spring Security + JPA/Hibernate + PostgreSQL + Flyway.
- Angular 17 frontend.
- Tenant isolation and server-verified identity are mandatory.
- Preserve financial precision, concurrency safety, and idempotency.
- AI is optional and must not block core rental workflows.
- No new microservices/Kafka/Kubernetes/CQRS/event sourcing unless explicitly required.
- Never commit real secrets or customer data.

## Implementation Tasks
1. Add request correlation ID filter supporting validated inbound `X-Request-Id` or server-generated value.
2. Return request ID in responses.
3. Put requestId and trusted tenant/user identity into MDC after authentication where safe.
4. Use structured JSON logging in production while keeping readable local logs.
5. Redact passwords, JWTs, API keys, auth headers, payment details, and sensitive PII.
6. Improve exception logging to use structured context instead of printStackTrace.

## Engineering Requirements
1. Inspect code/tests/docs first.
2. Use Flyway for DB changes.
3. Keep persistence tenant-scoped.
4. Keep controllers thin.
5. Validate untrusted input and fail closed.
6. Add automated tests for material changes.
7. Do not disable existing tests.
8. Update operational docs when behavior changes.

## Verification
```bash
cd backend
mvn test
mvn verify

cd ../frontend
npm ci
npm test -- --watch=false
npm run build
```

Run any additional operational/security checks required.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Every request has traceable ID.
- [ ] Tenant/user MDC uses trusted identity only.
- [ ] Secrets/tokens not logged.
- [ ] Errors can be correlated by request ID.
- [ ] Existing security/tenant tests remain green.
- [ ] No unsafe secret/default introduced.
- [ ] Docs match implementation.

## Final Response Required
Return summary, files changed, design decisions, tests/results, commands run, security notes, remaining risks, and recommended commit message.
