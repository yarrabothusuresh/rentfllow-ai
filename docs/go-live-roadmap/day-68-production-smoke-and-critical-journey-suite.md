# Day 68 — Production Smoke and Critical Journey Suite

## Copy-Paste Coding Prompt

Act as a **Senior Java/Spring Boot Architect, Angular Architect, PostgreSQL Engineer, DevSecOps Engineer, and SaaS Production-Readiness Reviewer** working directly in `yarrabothusuresh/rentfllow-ai`.

Do **not** rebuild the project. Inspect the current implementation first and preserve completed functionality.

## Objective
Create a fast, deterministic, deployment-safe suite that proves critical customer journeys after release.

## Architecture Guardrails
- Keep the modular monolith.
- Java 17 + Spring Boot + Spring Security + JPA/Hibernate + PostgreSQL + Flyway.
- Angular 17 frontend.
- Tenant isolation and server-verified identity are mandatory.
- Preserve financial precision, concurrency safety, and idempotency.
- AI is optional and must not block core rental workflows.
- No new microservices/Kafka/Kubernetes/CQRS/event sourcing unless explicitly required.
- Never commit real secrets or customer data.

## Implementation Tasks
1. Cover staff login/authentication.
2. Cover catalog/product retrieval and safe synthetic customer creation.
3. Cover quote creation and quote-to-booking conversion with inventory reservation.
4. Cover test-provider payment behavior without real charge.
5. Cover warehouse/return critical path.
6. Cover customer portal authentication/access.
7. Use a dedicated synthetic smoke tenant/account and deterministic cleanup.
8. Separate destructive tests from safe production smoke checks.

## Engineering Requirements
1. Inspect code/tests/docs first.
2. Use Flyway for DB changes.
3. Keep persistence tenant-scoped.
4. Keep controllers thin.
5. Validate untrusted input and fail closed.
6. Add automated tests for material changes.
7. Do not disable existing tests.
8. Update operational docs when behavior changes.

## Verification
```bash
cd backend
mvn test
mvn verify

cd ../frontend
npm ci
npm test -- --watch=false
npm run build
```

Run additional DR/release/staging checks required for this day.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Critical revenue journey is covered.
- [ ] Suite is fast/actionable.
- [ ] No real customer data/payment is touched.
- [ ] Production smoke uses dedicated safe identities.
- [ ] Existing tenant-isolation/security tests remain green.
- [ ] No unsafe secret/default introduced.
- [ ] Docs match implementation.

## Final Response Required
Return summary, files changed, design decisions, tests/results, commands run, security notes, remaining risks, and recommended commit message.
