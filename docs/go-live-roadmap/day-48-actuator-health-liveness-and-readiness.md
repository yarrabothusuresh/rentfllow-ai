# Day 48 — Actuator Health Liveness and Readiness

## Copy-Paste Coding Prompt

Act as a **Senior Java/Spring Boot Architect, Angular Architect, PostgreSQL Engineer, DevSecOps Engineer, and SaaS Production-Readiness Reviewer** working directly in `yarrabothusuresh/rentfllow-ai`.

Do **not** rebuild the project. Inspect the current implementation first and preserve completed functionality.

## Objective
Expose safe operational health endpoints with correct liveness/readiness semantics.

## Architecture Guardrails
- Keep the modular monolith.
- Java 17 + Spring Boot + Spring Security + JPA/Hibernate + PostgreSQL + Flyway.
- Angular 17 frontend.
- Tenant isolation and server-verified identity are mandatory.
- Preserve financial precision, concurrency safety, and idempotency.
- AI is optional and must not block core rental workflows.
- No new microservices/Kafka/Kubernetes/CQRS/event sourcing unless explicitly required.
- Never commit real secrets or customer data.

## Implementation Tasks
1. Add Spring Boot Actuator dependency and minimal safe management configuration.
2. Define liveness independent of temporary downstream provider outages.
3. Define readiness so database/application unavailability prevents traffic.
4. Secure management endpoints and never expose environment/config secrets.
5. Align Docker/deployment health checks with the implemented endpoints.
6. Add tests for healthy and unhealthy readiness behavior.

## Engineering Requirements
1. Inspect code/tests/docs first.
2. Use Flyway for DB changes.
3. Keep persistence tenant-scoped.
4. Keep controllers thin.
5. Validate untrusted input and fail closed.
6. Add automated tests for material changes.
7. Do not disable existing tests.
8. Update operational docs when behavior changes.

## Verification
```bash
cd backend
mvn test
mvn verify

cd ../frontend
npm ci
npm test -- --watch=false
npm run build
```

Run any additional operational/security checks required.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Real health endpoint exists.
- [ ] DB outage affects readiness.
- [ ] Liveness avoids unnecessary restart loops.
- [ ] Sensitive actuator endpoints are not public.
- [ ] Existing security/tenant tests remain green.
- [ ] No unsafe secret/default introduced.
- [ ] Docs match implementation.

## Final Response Required
Return summary, files changed, design decisions, tests/results, commands run, security notes, remaining risks, and recommended commit message.
